$ docker-compose up -d
```

# Why use Bitnami Images?

* Bitnami closely tracks upstream source changes and promptly publishes new versions of this image using our automated systems.
* With Bitnami images the latest bug fixes and features are available as soon as possible.
* Bitnami containers, virtual machines and cloud images use the same components and configuration approach - making it easy to switch between formats based on your project needs.
* Bitnami images are built on CircleCI and automatically pushed to the Docker Hub.
* All our images are based on [minideb](https://github.com/bitnami/minideb) a minimalist Debian based container image which gives you a small base container image and the familiarity of a leading linux distribution.

# Get this image

The recommended way to get the Bitnami PHP-FPM Docker Image is to pull the prebuilt image from the [Docker Hub Registry](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/php-fpm).

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/php-fpm:latest
```

To use a specific version, you can pull a versioned tag. You can view the [list of available versions](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/php-fpm/tags/) in the Docker Hub Registry.

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/php-fpm:[TAG]
```

If you wish, you can also build the image yourself.

```bash
$ docker build -t bitnami/php-fpm https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-php-fpm.git
```

# Connecting to other containers

This image is designed to be used with a web server to serve your PHP app, you can use docker networking to create a network and attach all the containers to that network.

## Serving your PHP app through an nginx frontend

We will use PHP-FPM with nginx to serve our PHP app. Doing so will allow us to setup more complex configuration, serve static assets using nginx, load balance to different PHP-FPM instances, etc.

### Step 1: Create a network

```bash
$ docker network create app-tier --driver bridge
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

networks:
  app-tier:
    driver: bridge
```

### Step 2: Create a virtual host

Let's create an nginx virtual host to reverse proxy to our PHP-FPM container.

```nginx
server {
  listen 0.0.0.0:80;
  server_name myapp.com;

  root /app;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/index.php;
  }

  location ~ \.php$ {
    # fastcgi_pass [PHP_FPM_LINK_NAME]:9000;
    fastcgi_pass phpfpm:9000;
    fastcgi_index index.php;
    include fastcgi.conf;
  }
}
```

Notice we've substituted the link alias name `myapp`, we will use the same name when creating the container.

Copy the virtual host above, saving the file somewhere on your host. We will mount it as a volume in our nginx container.

### Step 3: Run the PHP-FPM image with a specific name

Docker's linking system uses container ids or names to reference containers. We can explicitly specify a name for our PHP-FPM server to make it easier to connect to other containers.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name phpfpm \
  --network app-tier \
  -v ./php.d:/opt/bitnami/php/lib/php.d \
  -v /path/to/app:/app \
  bitnami/php-fpm
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  phpfpm:
    image: 'bitnami/php-fpm:latest'
    networks:
      - app-tier
    volumes:
      - ./php.d:/opt/bitnami/php/lib/php.d
      - /path/to/app:/app
```

### Step 4: Run the nginx image

```bash
$ docker run -it \
  -v /path/to/vhost.conf:/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/yourapp.conf \
  --network app-tier \
  bitnami/nginx
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
services:
  nginx:
    image: 'bitnami/nginx:latest'
    depends_on:
      - phpfpm
    networks:
      - app-tier
    ports:
      - '80:80'
      - '443:443'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/vhost.conf:/bitnami/nginx/conf/vhosts/yourapp.conf
```

# PHP runtime

Since this image bundles a PHP runtime, you may want to make use of PHP outside of PHP-FPM. By default, running this image will start a server. To use the PHP runtime instead, we can override the the default command Docker runs by stating a different command to run after the image name.

## Entering the REPL

PHP provides a REPL where you can interactively test and try things out in PHP.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name phpfpm bitnami/php-fpm php -a
```

# Running your PHP script

The default work directory for the PHP-FPM image is `/app`. You can mount a folder from your host here that includes your PHP script, and run it normally using the `php` command.

```bash
$ docker run -it --name php-fpm -v /path/to/app:/app bitnami/php-fpm \
  php script.php
```

# Configuration

You can mount a custom config file from your host to edit the default configuration for the php-fpm docker image. The following is an example to alter the configuration of the _php-fpm.conf_ configuration file:

### Step 1: Run the PHP-FPM image

Run the PHP-FPM image, mounting a file from your host.

```bash
$ docker run --name phpfpm -v /path/to/php-fpm.conf:/opt/bitnami/php/etc/php-fpm.conf bitnami/php-fpm
```

or using Docker Compose:

```yaml
version: '2'

services:
  phpfpm:
    image: 'bitnami/php-fpm:latest'
    ports:
      - '9000:9000'
    volumes:
      - /path/to/php-fpm.conf:/opt/bitnami/php/etc/php-fpm.conf
```

### Step 2: Edit the configuration

Edit the configuration on your host using your favorite editor.

```bash
$ vi /path/to/php-fpm.conf
```

### Step 3: Restart PHP-FPM

After changing the configuration, restart your PHP-FPM container for the changes to take effect.

```bash
$ docker restart phpfpm
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose restart phpfpm
```

# Logging

The Bitnami PHP-FPM Docker Image sends the container logs to the `stdout`. You can configure the containers [logging driver](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#logging-drivers-log-driver) using the `--log-driver` option. By defauly the `json-file` driver is used.

To view the logs:

```bash
$ docker logs phpfpm
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose logs phpfpm
```

*The `docker logs` command is only available when the `json-file` or `journald` logging driver is in use.*

# Maintenance

## Upgrade this image

Bitnami provides up-to-date versions of PHP-FPM, including security patches, soon after they are made upstream. We recommend that you follow these steps to upgrade your container.

### Step 1: Get the updated image

```bash
$ docker pull bitnami/php-fpm:latest
```

or if you're using Docker Compose, update the value of the image property to
`bitnami/php-fpm:latest`.

### Step 2: Stop and backup the currently running container

Stop the currently running container using the command

```bash
$ docker stop php-fpm
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose stop php-fpm
```

Next, take a snapshot of the persistent volume `/path/to/php-fpm-persistence` using:

```bash
$ rsync -a /path/to/php-fpm-persistence /path/to/php-fpm-persistence.bkp.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H.%M.%S)
```

You can use this snapshot to restore the database state should the upgrade fail.

### Step 3: Remove the currently running container

```bash
$ docker rm -v phpfpm
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose rm -v phpfpm
```

### Step 4: Run the new image

Re-create your container from the new image.

```bash
$ docker run --name phpfpm bitnami/php-fpm:latest
```

or using Docker Compose:

```bash
$ docker-compose start phpfpm
```

# Notable Changes

## 7.0.6-r0 (2016-05-17)

- All volumes have been merged at `/bitnami/php-fpm`. Now you only need to mount a single volume at `/bitnami/php-fpm` for persistence.
- The logs are always sent to the `stdout` and are no longer collected in the volume.

## 5.5.30-2 (2015-12-07)

- Enables support for imagick extension

## 5.5.30-0-r01 (2015-11-10)

- `php.ini` is now exposed in the volume mounted at `/bitnami/php-fpm/conf/` allowing users to change the defaults as per their requirements.

## 5.5.30-0 (2015-10-06)

- `/app` directory is no longer exported as a volume. This caused problems when building on top of the image, since changes in the volume are not persisted between Dockerfile `RUN` instructions. To keep the previous behavior (so that you can mount the volume in another container), create the container with the `-v /app` option.
